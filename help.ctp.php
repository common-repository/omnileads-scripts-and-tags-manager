       <strong>Remarketing and dynamic remarketing</strong></a>
       <p>When dynamic remarketing is enabled on the settings tab then one tag can be added to all pages next to that single pages can be tagged 
        with a single tag. When the conversion id is added and enabled, then the normal remarketing tag is added to the source of all pages not having 
        a dynamic remarketing tag. For this the conversion id needs to be filled in and the checkbox checked to enable normal
        remarketing. For pages that have a dynamic tag no standard tag is added and for all pages without a dynamic tag the standard remarketing tag
        will added if the conversion id is added and remarketing has been enabled.
